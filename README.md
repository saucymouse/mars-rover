# mars-rover

This project put our unit testing, modules making, and exception handling knowledge to use by writing tests and classes for the Mars rover named Curiosity. We created a simulation for issuing commands to Curiosity. The idea was to create a command at mission control, convert that command into a message send it to the rover, then have the rover respond to that message.

Without a traditional UI, and still feeling like I was getting my legs under me in LaunchCode, this was an incredibly difficult project for me. But it greatly helped me understand the importance of unit testing, and completing the project was a major milestone in my LaunchCode journey.
