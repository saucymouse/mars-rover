# mars-rover

This project put our unit testing, modules making, and exception handling knowledge to use by writing tests and classes for the Mars rover named Curiosity. We created a simulation for issuing commands to Curiosity. The idea was to create a command at mission control, convert that command into a message send it to the rover, then have the rover respond to that message.
